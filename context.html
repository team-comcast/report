        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>Today, Comcast is the largest Cable and Home Internet Provider in the U.S. We have over 30 million cable subscribers and over 20 million Internet subscribers. This year in the first quarter alone, we brought in over $1.1 billion. According to the numbers, we’re doing pretty great.</p>
        <p>However, there’s a definite disconnect between how we view ourselves and how our customers view us. To get a better idea of our customers’ perspectives, we conducted a survey and asked about 100 customers about their experiences with Comcast. A lot of them focused on call center interactions, and as you can see, we got a number of negative comments.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <ul>
            <li>“Comcast is the bane of my existence. I've never had a good interaction with them and would not subject myself to their unethical practices if given an option.”
            <li>“I was transferred from person to person and never got the solution to my problem.”
            <li>“They don't seem like they want to help me.”
            <li>“Stop caring about your bottom line and start caring about your customers.” 
            <li>“We're never going to catch up to other countries in terms of internet infrastructure with companies like Comcast being primary provider.”
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Our survey also asked how they would rate our customer service on a scale of 1 to 5. Out of 100 people, only 2 rated us at a 5. As a company overall, only 1 out of 100 people rated us at a 5. For both of these questions, most people voted Comcast as a 3 or less, showing how poorly people view us.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6"><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jenoc31.png" style="width:90%"/></center></div>
            <div class="col-md-6"><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zJUF1aX.png" style="width:90%"/></center></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Even though our survey data is limited, our surveyees aren’t the only ones who think they way they do. In a survey by Consumer Affairs, 98% of people gave Comcast a score of 1 or 2 out of 5. In 2010 and 2014, Comcast won Consumerist’s “Worst Company in America” Award and was mailed this Golden Poo statue.</p>
        <p>Apparently, it’s not just customers who are unhappy, but Comcast employees as well. On an online forum, Reddit, Comcast employees talked about their experiences and how they viewed Comcast management. They felt restrained from helping customers and mentioned that upper management actually discouraged them from helping them out.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <ul>
            <li>“The corporate culture and management are only concerned with sales. Service is nothing of interest. You are not on the phone to help customers, you are there to sell them more services.”
            <li>“Requirements from 'upper management' become more strict, and not on promoting people to work harder but discouraging us from being helpful.”
            <li>“The technical departments chase metrics on spreadsheets and cannot afford to care or to go the extra mile for customers.”
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>According to the following quote by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, he claims that with over 350 million customer interactions per year, it’s unacceptable to have so many bad experiences. And yet, according to our survey data and many other online sources, Comcast is known for their bad customer experiences.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <p><em>“What unfortunately happens is we have about ... 350 million interactions with consumers a year, between phone calls and truck calls. It may be over 400 million and that doesn’t count any online interactions which I think is over a billion. You get one-tenth of one-percent bad experience, that’s a lot of people - unacceptable. We have to be the best service provider or in the end, this company won’t be what I want it to be.”</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>So why is this? Let's do a quick "5 Why's" framework.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <ul>
            <li>Why do Comcast customers have such bad experiences?<br>
              <em>Because Comcast as a company does not prioritizee customer service.</em>
            <li>Why?<br>
              <em>Because they value sales and revenue over customer satisfaction.</em>
            <li>Why?<br>
              <em>Because they can! They have no competition.</em>
            <li>Why?<br>
              <em>Because they are an oligopoly.</em>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>What is an oligopoly? Well essentially, it’s like a monopoly, only legal. A small group of cable and Internet providers make an agreement with each other to set their prices at certain levels and essentially eliminate all competition, making us the one of the few good options out there.</p>
        <p>However, it's not always going to be this way. Competitors, like Google Fiber, are on the rise, and we need to prepare ourselves for the imminent competition.</p>
