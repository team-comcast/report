        <h1>Business Problem 1 - Repeat Calls</h1>
        <p>Comcast has an excessive amount of repeat calls, meaning that customers call more than once within 24 hours.<br></p>
        <div style="margin-left:10px">
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>This script is a list of tools that will be used each financial quarter to evaluate call center employee performance. Using the tools will allow Comcast to evaluate individual customer service, individual call center performance and Comcast customer service. Performance evaluation will be used to identify both customer service strengths and gaps to ensure that Comcast remains a leader in the cable/service provider industry and provides exemplary customer service.<br><br></p>
          <div style="margin-left:10px">
            <h4>Tool 1: 360 degree feedback</h4>
            <p>360 degree feedback evaluates individual call center employees. It will incorporate feedback from internal/external customers, superiors, subordinates, coworkers, and sales people.<br><br></p>
            <h4>Tool 2: Employee balanced scorecard</h4>
            <p>The employee balanced scorecard will grade call center employees using the following quantitative metrics: percentage of calls that are repeat calls; average customer hold time; percentage of call resolution; average customer satisfaction rating; ability to connect customer with technician; ability to reconnect with customer after a blocked call.<br><br></p>
            <h4>Tool 3: Self evaluation</h4>
            <p>Employee self-evaluation will allow an employee to reflect on individual performance. It will include both quantitative analysis of their balanced scorecard and a qualitative analysis of their perceived performance. Self Evaluation will require quarterly reflection, goal setting, and encourage employees to communicate their need as Comcast employees.<br><br></p>

        <h1>Business Problem 2 - Long Hold Times</h1>
        <p>Comcast customers experience long hold times when calling into customer service.<br></p>
        <div style="margin-left:10px">
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>The following two tools are useful for improving employee effectiveness and happiness as well as create a call center that runs more smoothly.<br><br></p>
          <div style="margin-left:10px">
            <h4>Tool 1: Mandatory Meetings</h4>
            <p>Each month, every call center will host a mandatory monthly meeting that entails an employee workshop to touch base with all the representatives. We think this will motivate employees, build call-center camaraderie, and ensure employees are prepared to serve the customer.<br><br></p>

      <div class="page-opening">
        <h1>Business Problem 3 - Consumption Model</h1>
        <p>Customers are given packages with many more channels than they actually want to watch.<br></p>
        <div style="margin-left:10px">
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>This issue was much more difficult to solve. We looked at a couple of different options as well as the following tradeoffs.<br><br></p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6"><center><b>Current Consumption Model Tradeoffs</b><br><br><br><img src="http://puu.sh/9g8Vj/b04792f931.png" style="width:100%"/></center></div>
            <div class="col-md-6"><center><b>Improved Consumption Model Tradeoffs</b><br><br><img src="http://puu.sh/9g8W0/5977fda570.png" style="width:90%"/></center></div>
          </div>
          <p><br>We came up with two options for breaking the bundle.<br><br></p>
          <div style="margin-left:10px">
            <h4>Option A</h4>
            <p>Premade, smaller bundles specially designed for individual customer segments.<br><br></p>
            <div class="well">
              <p>Example packages:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Sports Fan ($30/month): ESPN, Speed, Rugby Channel, etc.
                <li>Music World ($20/month): MTV, VH1, etc.
                <li>Kid Central ($20/month): Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, etc.
                <li>The Retired Gentleperson ($30/month): History Channel, Golf Channel, Infomercial Channel, etc. 
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Package design will be based on extensive market research. Each of these packages would contain both premium and less popular channels, but all included channels are related to the interests of the customer segment for which it the package is designed. Quantity based pricing will be used, e.g. 1 package for $20/month, 2 packages for $30/month.<p><br><br></p>
            <h4>Option B</h4>
            <p>Make your own Custom Package using a point system. Each channel will be assigned a point value based on popularity.<br><br></p>
            <div class="well">
              <p>Example packages:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>HBO = 15 points
                <li>Lifetime = 6 points
                <li>DIY Network = 1 point
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Customers will choose a Custom Package Tier that allots them a certain number of points, e.g. Tier 1 = 40 points for $20/month, Tier 2 = 75 points for $30/month.</p>
