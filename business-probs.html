        <h1>Business Problems</h1>
        <p>We focused on two major problems that we felt were Comcast's biggest problems: their consumption model, and their customer service.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h4>Consumption Model:</h4><p>Currently, cable users, on average, subscribe to over 180 channels when in reality, the consumer only wants 17 on average.</p></li>
          <li><h4>Customer Service:</h4><p>Comcast currently has poor customer service because call agents are incentivized and trained to not help the customer, and process and procedures prevent the agent from serving customer needs.</p></li>
        </ul>
