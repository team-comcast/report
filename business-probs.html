        <h1>Business Problems</h1>
        <p>We focused on two major problems that we felt were Comcast's biggest problems: their consumption model, and their customer service.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h4>Consumption Model:</h4>
            <p><em>Comcast currently has poor customer interactions because call agents are incentivized and trained to not help the customer. Process and procedures within the call centers prevent the agent from serving customer needs. This manifests in the two business problems that follow.</em></p>
            <p>Currently, Comcast has an excessive amount of repeat calls. In our research, we found that Comcast is actually satisfied that 1 in 5 customers contact customer service without their problems being resolved. In our survey, almost half of our sample group has called customer service more than 3 times, many of them within less than a year of subscribing to Comcast services. All of this shows that Comcast does not focus on first call resolution. In fact, the company expects representatives to complete their cable-related calls between 7-7.5 minutes, telephone-related calls within 9 minutes, and Internet calls between 11-11.5 minutes. Their employee performance metrics are based on quantitative time, not customer satisfaction. In fact, customer service representatives state that upper management does not promote people to work harder, but actually discourages people from being helpful. </p>
            <p>Comcast customers have experienced long hold times as they are shuffled and transferred through the “rusted, broken down pipe” that is Comcast’s customer service system. 36% of Comcast customers we surveyed had to wait longer than 15 minutes on hold while they were speaking to customer service representatives. Many of our survey takers also complained about their frustrations with constantly being transferred. This is likely attributed to their representatives incorrectly analyzing what the customer’s problems are. This causes inefficient use of resource because each customer is transferred to several specialized representatives who are not trained in those particular areas to help them. Many users have also exhibited frustration with automated call services. They prefer to speak to a person rather than a machine, but that person needs to be able to properly assist them.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Customer Service:</h4>
            <p><em>Comcast does not offer enough customization in their consumption model, instead requiring consumers to purchase bulky packages. This includes both excess of services (internet+cable when consumer does not want cable) and excess of channels within cable service.</em></p>
            <p>Currently, cable users, on average, subscribe to over 180 channels when in reality, the consumer only wants 17 on average. This is because Comcast has bound itself legally to its network and content partners. They are balancing on the thin line between upsetting their contracted partners by not including specific channels in a quota of packages and upsetting their customers by making them pay for something they do not want. They are playing it safe by spreading localized need throughout its entire customer base to reduce the cost of variability. As it currently stands, Comcast is part of an oligopoly and does not need to tailor its products and services to each individual customer. However, this will not last forever, and when customers have more options to choose from, Comcast needs to know exactly what its customers want. If a system to facilitate this is not already in place by the time change comes, Comcast will lose customers and money.</p>
